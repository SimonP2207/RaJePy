This directory contains all configurations for relevant telescopes.

Most have been directly copied from CASA's telescope configurations and a complete description can be found [here](https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php/Antenna_Configurations_Models_in_CASA_Cycle6). Some have been selectively left out since they are irrelevant (e.g. ACA configurations) or historical (e.g. ALMA Cycle 0 --> 7 configurations).

MeerKAT, SKA and LOFAR antenna files have been copied from [here](https://github.com/ratt-ru/simms/tree/master/simms/observatories).

As for the eMERLIN configuration file, the source is unknown!
